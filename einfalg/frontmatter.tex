\chapter*{Introduction}
These are my personal lecture notes for the lecture \textit{Introduction to Algebra} held by Prof. Dr. Jan Schr√∂er at the University of Bonn in the winter term 2018/19.\par
I try to update them on my website, \url{https://pankratius.github.io}.\\
The authors labels his own comments and additions in \textcolor{purple}{purple}.\par
The book \cite{aluffi} is used by the author for further references, and highly recommended.


I will write them in English, as Prof. Schroer already provides a german version of his lecture notes. In addition, the first two lectures are ommited, as they were only motivational, but my motivation to draw a lot of pictures is fairly limited.
