\subsection*{Extension and restriction of scalars}
We do some recap from Algebra 1 (cf. \cite[27f.]{atiyah1994introduction}). For this, we go back to the commutative case: In the following, $A,B$ denote commutative, untial rings. \\
\begin{prop}
  Let $A\far{f}B$ be a ring homomorphism and $N$ a $B$-module. Then $N$ has a $A$-module structure, given by
  \[
  A\times N\mapsto N,~(a,n)\mapsto f(a)n.\]
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The addition on $N_A$  is the same as the addition of $N_B$. \\
    \item Associativity: $(ab)n = f(ab)n = (f(a)f(b))n = f(a)(f(b)n)$, as $N$ is $B$-module
    \item Unit acts as unit: $1_An = f(1_A)n = 1_Bn = n$, as $f$ is homomorphism of rings.
    \item Distributivity: $(a+b)n=f(a+b)n = (f(a)+f(b))n = f(a)n+f(b)n$ and $a(n+n') = f(a)(n+n') = f(a)n+f(a)n'$
  \end{itemize}
\end{proof}
This way of obtaining a $A$-module structure on $N_B$ is called \toidx{restriction of scalars}. In particular, $f$ defines a $A$-module structure on $B$ in this way.\\
\begin{prop}
  Let $M_A$ be an $A$-module. Then
  \[
  M_B:= B\otimes_A M
  \]

  carries a $B$-module structure, and
  \[
  b(b'\otimes x) = (bb')\otimes x
  \]
  holds for this $B$-module. We say that the $B$-module $M_B$ was obtained from $M$ by \toidx{extension of scalars}
\end{prop}
